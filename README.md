QTouchShield for Arduino
========================

Introduction to the project
---------------------------

The QTouchShield for Arduino project aims to design a hardware platform for the Arduino MEGA that supports up to 32 configurable capacitive touch inputs.

The inputs can be configured as:

* Buttons
* Sliders
* Wheels
* Proximity sensors

Additionally the project includes the necessary firmware required by the shield's microcontroller to enable this functionality.

Key Capabilties
---------------
* Support up to 32 capacitive touch inputs supporting:
	* up to 8 sliders/wheels
	* up to 32 buttons
	* up to 32 proximity sensors
* Configuration via SPI or UART (RX/TX) interfaces
* Arduino library to simplify integration into sketches
